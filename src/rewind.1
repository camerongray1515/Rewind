.SH NAME
rewind \- Execute a command and automatically execute a "rollback command" if
user does not respond by running the "keep" command
.SH SYNOPSIS
rewind run <CHANGE_COMMAND> <ROLLBACK_COMMAND> [-t TIMEOUT_VALUE]

rewind keep
.SH DESCRIPTION
rewind allows the user to execute a command that makes a change to a system and
then after a period of time, if the user has not issued the "keep" command,
will automatically execute a command to restore the system to the previous
state.  It is designed for changing settings that run the risk of locking the
user out of the system - For example, altering network settings on a remote
machine only accessible over SSH.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "CHANGE_COMMAND"
This command is what makes the change to the system such as restarting the
service that has been modified.

.IP "ROLLBACK_COMMAND"
This command should revert the system to its previous stage.  For example,
copying a backup of the configuration file to the appropriate location and then
restarting the appropriate service.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP  "-h,"
Number of seconds to wait before executing the rollback command.  Defaults to
30 seconds.

.SH USAGE
Execute "rewind run <CHANGE_COMMAND> <ROLLBACK_COMMAND>" - The change command
will be executed.

If changes are successful, execute "rewind keep" which will stop the rollback
command from being executed.

If changes were not successful, wait for the timeout period (default 30 seconds)
to elapse, the rollback command will then be executed.


.SH EXAMPLES
.IP "rewind run ""touch foo"" ""rm foo"" -t 60"
Create a file called "foo", if the user does not execute the keep command within
60 seconds, the file will be deleted.
.IP "rewind run ""touch foo && rm bar"" ""rm foo && touch bar"""
Multiple commands can be supplied by joining them with "&&"
.IP "rewind run ""./change.sh"" ""./rollback.sh"""
Shell scripts can be supplied instead of bare commands
.IP "rewind keep"
Keep the changes from the previous run (i.e. do not run the rollback command)
